About

Hello! My name is Leshawn Rice, and I'm a Software Developer from the Greater Seattle area. I primarily use Javascript and Python but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem for me. I'm comfortable developing on the frontend and the backend, and I enjoy challenging myself to make seamless, efficient, and scalable applications.


Backend
My bread and butter is <strong>Express</strong>. When working with a backend in Javascript, the staI'm most familiar with is PostgreSQL, Express, and Node.js, but like I said picking up a new framewoor language isn't a problem for me, so I can quickly adapt to a MEAN stack without much difficulty.

When working in a Python backend, the framework I'm most familiar with is Flask. While Flask is easy to work with and provides a lot of flexibiliy, I've been getting more into using Django since they added asynchronous support.
